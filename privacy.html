  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Explainish Chrome Extension &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>Explainish is a Chrome extension that helps you summarize and understand web content using Google's Gemini AI. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and what is never collected.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p>Explainish collects anonymous usage analytics to understand how the extension is being used and to improve it over time. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A randomly generated anonymous installation ID (not linked to your identity)</li>
    <li>Feature usage events (e.g. "user clicked Summarize", "user used Explain")</li>
    <li>General website category of the page being used on (e.g. "news", "tech") — not the URL or page content</li>
    <li>Session and retention signals (e.g. how often the extension is opened)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is collected via Google Analytics (Measurement Protocol) and is fully anonymous. It cannot be used to identify you.</p>

  <h2>What we never collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, or any personally identifiable information</li>
    <li>The content of pages you visit or summarize</li>
    <li>Your full browsing history or specific URLs</li>
    <li>Your Gemini API key</li>
    <li>Any data that could identify you as an individual</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your API key</h2>
  <p>Explainish requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage on your own device. It is never transmitted to us, never stored on any server, and never shared with any third party. The only use of your API key is to make direct requests from your browser to Google's Gemini API.</p>

  <h2>Page content</h2>
  <p>When you use Explainish to summarize a page or explain highlighted text, that content is sent directly from your browser to Google's Gemini API using your own API key. Explainish has no server — content never passes through any infrastructure we control. Google's handling of API requests is governed by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">Google's API Terms of Service</a>.</p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third party. Anonymous analytics data is processed by Google Analytics solely to help us improve the extension.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>Anonymous analytics data is retained in Google Analytics for 14 months, after which it is automatically deleted. No other data is retained by us because no other data is collected.</p>

  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>Explainish is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the date at the top of this page. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the extension's Chrome Web Store listing page or contact us via the support email listed there.</p>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:#aaa;">Explainish is an independent product and is not affiliated with Google LLC.</p>
