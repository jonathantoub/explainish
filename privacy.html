  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Explainish Chrome Extension &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>Explainish is a Chrome extension that helps you summarize and understand web content using Google's Gemini AI. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and what is never collected.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p>Explainish collects usage analytics to understand how the extension is being used and to improve it over time. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A randomly generated installation ID stored locally on your device. This ID is not linked to your name, email, or any personal identity.</li>
    <li>Feature usage events (e.g. "user clicked Summarize", "user used Explain")</li>
    <li>The domain name of the page being used on (e.g. example.com), but not the full URL, page content, or browsing history</li>
    <li>General website category of the active page (e.g. "news", "tech")</li>
    <li>Session and retention signals (e.g. how often the extension is opened)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Analytics data is associated with the randomly generated installation ID described above. Analytics data is transmitted directly from your browser to Google Analytics. We do not operate a server that receives or stores this data. Google Analytics may collect technical information such as IP address and browser metadata in accordance with its own privacy practices, described at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>What we never collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, or any personally identifiable information</li>
    <li>The content of pages you visit or summarize</li>
    <li>We do not store or have access to your prompts or AI responses — these are sent directly from your browser to Google's Gemini API using your own API key</li>
    <li>Full URLs or complete browsing history</li>
    <li>Your Gemini API key</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your API key</h2>
  <p>Explainish requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage on your own device. It is never transmitted to us, never stored on any server, and never shared with any third party. The only use of your API key is to make direct requests from your browser to Google's Gemini API.</p>

  <h2>Page content</h2>
  <p>When you use Explainish to summarize a page or explain highlighted text, that content is sent directly from your browser to Google's Gemini API using your own API key. Explainish has no server — content never passes through any infrastructure we control. Google's handling of API requests is governed by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">Google's API Terms of Service</a>.</p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third party. Analytics data is processed by Google Analytics solely to help us improve the extension.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>Analytics data is retained in Google Analytics for 14 months, after which it is automatically deleted. We do not store page content, prompts, responses, or API keys.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding access, correction, or deletion of personal data. Because Explainish does not collect personally identifiable information, we are generally unable to associate analytics data with any specific individual. If you have questions or requests regarding your data, please contact us via the support email listed on our Chrome Web Store page.</p>

  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>Explainish is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the date at the top of this page. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us via the support email listed on the Chrome Web Store listing page.</p>
